This is a React project created with Vite for a simple personal webpage explaining PhD motivations. The project uses:

- React with functional components and hooks
- Modern, clean styling with CSS modules or inline styles
- Simple, readable typography
- Responsive design principles
- Minimal dependencies to keep it lightweight

Focus on creating clean, semantic HTML structure and modern CSS styling that is easy to read and maintain.
