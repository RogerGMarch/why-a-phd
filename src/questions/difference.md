# You already do research—what's the difference with a PhD?

The main difference is that during a PhD, I'll be curating the research we're doing and making it *publishable*—so that others can benefit from it, not just the immediate team or project. Publishing is also a powerful way to position yourself, to demonstrate what you can do, and to build credibility in your field.

You'd be surprised by how much can change in your life just by adding a new *node* to a network. I see publishing not just as an academic obligation, but as a way to create bridges—connections to communities I wouldn't otherwise have access to.

What I feel is often missing in a regular job or research engineer position is that deeper sense of *belonging to a community*. While research can be competitive, especially in academia, it's also deeply collaborative and intersectional—at least in the field I plan to pursue. And that's something I truly value.
