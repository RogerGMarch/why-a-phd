# Aren't academic careers extremely competitive and unstable?

Yes, those doubts are real—and I share them. I *am* worried about what will happen after the PhD, or even whether I'll finish it. I haven't fully decided if I want to pursue the traditional academic path, with all the postdocs and uncertainty it involves.

But doing a PhD doesn't mean I'm committing to that one path. It doesn't mean I'll spend my 30s chasing academic positions and regretting not having built a more stable or fulfilling life.

The truth is, I also see myself as part-developer, part-builder. I enjoy creating my own projects, and I'm genuinely drawn to the idea of starting something—maybe a business, maybe something different—after the PhD. That, too, is a door this journey can open.
