# Is this really worth 3–5 more years of your life?

The idea of doing just *one thing* for several years can feel terrifying. But the truth is, during a PhD, I'll be doing *many* things I can't even predict yet.

I envision my PhD within a structured work schedule—for the sake of both my sanity and my productivity. Doing a PhD doesn't mean becoming a slave to academia or giving up on the rest of my life. I wouldn't do that in any other job either.

In fact, having a long-term project like this offers a certain kind of stability. For the duration of the PhD, I won't have to constantly worry about moving, switching jobs, or chasing the next opportunity. That *freedom from uncertainty* will help me focus—not just on the research, but on building a life around it.

In a way, I'm not narrowing my life—I'm grounding it, so I can go deeper.
