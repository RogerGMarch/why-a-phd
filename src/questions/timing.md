# Isn't it too late to start a PhD now?

Yes, it *seems* like I'm starting a PhD too late—but actually, this is the **right moment** for me.

Starting a PhD right after finishing my degree (and master's) would have been a mistake. Back then, I lacked perspective and mature work habits. I completed my degree without proper planning, and in physics, the curriculum wasn't really project- or long-term-oriented.

I'm glad I worked in the private sector first—it helped me discover what I enjoy and what I absolutely don't. That experience taught me how to manage projects independently, how to lead, communicate with clients, understand salary structures, and negotiate. These are **essential skills** in academia, even though many people in that world tend to overlook them.

Getting a taste of all that before starting a PhD has given me the confidence to handle a long-term project and, more importantly, a clear sense of how—and where—I **don't** want to work.
