          <p>
            A lot of people ask me this‚Äîusually with a puzzled look, a sigh, or even a face that says <em>"poor soul."</em><br />
            They wonder: <em>"Why a PhD if you're already working in research?"</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The truth is, life changes quickly. You may think you've mapped your future out clearly, but even the near-term is full of surprises. What feels like a stable plan can shift overnight. For me, doing a PhD is not about following a rigid path‚Äîit's about <strong>opening the right doors</strong> and <strong>reducing uncertainty</strong> in the long run.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've learned that to work on what you love <em>and</em> have stability, you need to design a path that blends both freedom and opportunity. That's what a PhD can offer: the space to dive deep, explore, and shape your own expertise‚Äîwhile staying embedded in the scientific ecosystem I already enjoy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's long. But I'm in a field (computational data science) where a PhD doesn't have to mean sacrificing your income or living precariously. There are ways to make it work‚Äîand even thrive‚Äîwhile doing meaningful, publishable, fun work.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And honestly? I want to earn well. I want to grow. I want to be challenged. I could not settle for less.

              <p>
                Yes, it <em>seems</em> like I'm starting a PhD too late‚Äîbut actually, this is the <strong>right moment</strong> for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting a PhD right after finishing my degree (and master's) would have been a mistake. Back then, I lacked perspective and mature work habits. I completed my degree without proper planning, and in physics, the curriculum wasn't really project- or long-term-oriented.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm glad I worked in the private sector first‚Äîit helped me discover what I enjoy and what I absolutely don't. That experience taught me how to manage projects independently, how to lead, communicate with clients, understand salary structures, and negotiate. These are <strong>essential skills</strong> in academia, even though many people in that world tend to overlook them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting a taste of all that before starting a PhD has given me the confidence to handle a long-term project and, more importantly, a clear sense of how‚Äîand where‚ÄîI <strong>don't</strong> want to work.

              <p>
                Yes, those doubts are real‚Äîand I share them. I <em>am</em> worried about what will happen after the PhD, or even whether I'll finish it. I haven't fully decided if I want to pursue the traditional academic path, with all the postdocs and uncertainty it involves.
              </p>
              <p>
                But doing a PhD doesn't mean I'm committing to that one path. It doesn't mean I'll spend my 30s chasing academic positions and regretting not having built a more stable or fulfilling life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The truth is, I also see myself as part-developer, part-builder. I enjoy creating my own projects, and I'm genuinely drawn to the idea of starting something‚Äîmaybe a business, maybe something different‚Äîafter the PhD. That, too, is a door this journey can open.

              <p>
                The main difference is that during a PhD, I'll be curating the research we're doing and making it <em>publishable</em>‚Äîso that others can benefit from it, not just the immediate team or project. Publishing is also a powerful way to position yourself, to demonstrate what you can do, and to build credibility in your field.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'd be surprised by how much can change in your life just by adding a new <em>node</em> to a network. I see publishing not just as an academic obligation, but as a way to create bridges‚Äîconnections to communities I wouldn't otherwise have access to.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I feel is often missing in a regular job or research engineer position is that deeper sense of <em>belonging to a community</em>. While research can be competitive, especially in academia, it's also deeply collaborative and intersectional‚Äîat least in the field I plan to pursue. And that's something I truly value.
              </p>

            </button>
            <div className={`question-content ${expandedQuestions['worth'] ? 'expanded' : 'collapsed'}`}>
              <p>
                The idea of doing just <em>one thing</em> for several years can feel terrifying. But the truth is, during a PhD, I'll be doing <em>many</em> things I can't even predict yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                I envision my PhD within a structured work schedule‚Äîfor the sake of both my sanity and my productivity. Doing a PhD doesn't mean becoming a slave to academia or giving up on the rest of my life. I wouldn't do that in any other job either.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, having a long-term project like this offers a certain kind of stability. For the duration of the PhD, I won't have to constantly worry about moving, switching jobs, or chasing the next opportunity. That <em>freedom from uncertainty</em> will help me focus‚Äînot just on the research, but on building a life around it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a way, I'm not narrowing my life‚ÄîI'm grounding it, so I can go deeper.

              <p>
                This is probably the most practical question, and I'm glad people ask it. A PhD doesn't have to mean being broke for 4-6 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                In computational data science, there are <strong>funded positions</strong>, industry collaborations, and consulting opportunities that can make a PhD financially viable. I've seen colleagues who managed to maintain a decent income while pursuing their research.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plus, my current experience gives me leverage to negotiate better conditions or find hybrid arrangements that combine research with practical applications.
